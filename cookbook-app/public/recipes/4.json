  "description": "A simple, uncomplicated Seekh Kebab recipe made with ingredients you likely have on hand. This recipe includes tips on how to make flavorful, tender kebabs that don’t break or fall off the skewers. Includes pan-frying, baking, and air-frying instructions.",
  "steps": [
    "Toast & grind the spices. Toasting deepens the flavor while removing the raw taste of the spices. This is especially important if you’re baking the kebabs.",
    "Pulse to chop the onion, cilantro, mint, and green chili. Squeeze out the excess moisture and add to the ground beef.",
    "Add the remaining ingredients to the ground beef and mix to combine.",
    "Mix/knead the dough vigorously until you can see the stringy texture of the meat. I like to use the paddle attachment of a stand mixer to do this.",
    "Shape the kebab. See instructions and video on how to do this.",
    "Cook! Grill, pan-fry, air-fry, or bake."
