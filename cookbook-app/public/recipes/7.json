  "description": "For some, this vague and imprecise approach produces a satisfactory result. The noodles are warm, the broth is seasoned.",
  "steps": [
    "Bring 2 ½ cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the soup base and vegetable mix. Boil for 1 minute.",
    "Add the whole disc of dried noodles. Do not break the noodles in half. I know it’s fun to break stuff, but you must resist. Instead, slip the noodles into the boiling broth and press them down with chopsticks or a fork to keep them submerged. Don't stir the noodles—just keep them submerged. After 2 minutes, the noodles will soften and break apart.",
    "This is critical: I find that simply boiling the noodles for 4-5 minutes, as most ramen directions read, produces a limp and soggy noodle. To avoid this, you have to slow down the noodle’s cooking process while the broth continues to cook. The best way to do this: fan the noodles.",
    "Return the now-cooled noodles to the broth and add your toppings. Next week I'll go into the many, many ways to top instant ramen. For now, let's focus on the classic. Crack a raw egg over the noodles, cover the pot, and boil for 30 seconds. Turn off the heat, cover and let sit for 30 seconds more. Serve immediately."
